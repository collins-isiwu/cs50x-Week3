## Plurality
Plurality is a C program that simulates an election. The program will take a sequence of votes as input and then output the winner of that election.

## Runoff
Runoff simulates a voting system known as the ranked-choice voting system. In a ranked-choice system, voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead of just voting for their top choice, they can rank the candidates in order of preference. Here, each voter, in addition to specifying their first preference candidate, has also indicated their choices.
